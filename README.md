# How to use
The model requires the following parameters as input: [''Mean_Corpuscular_Volume', 'Red_Blood_Cell_Distribution_Width', 'Mean_Corpuscular_Hemoglobin', 
                    'Hemoglobin', 'Mean_Corpuscular_Hemoglobin_Concentration', 'Erytrocytes', 'Trombocytes'].

A small script will be added in `apply_model` to apply the model to an excel file.
